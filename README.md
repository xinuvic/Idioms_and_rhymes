# Idioms_and_rhymes

May 27 update: Well, it seems that AI can perfectly replace this project LOL

This is a project for rappers to use idioms with rhymes. The project was developed when I watched the famous Chinese TV program "The Rap of China". I crawled all the Chinese idioms from URL 'http://chengyu.t086.com/'. Next, I found their pinyin using "hanzi2pinyin.py" (from https://blog.csdn.net/peishuai1987/article/details/89882872). Finally, the idioms are matched by checking their vowels.

Warning:
Too much crawling will lead to access deny. Trying only once is better if you wanna crawl all the Chinese idioms.
