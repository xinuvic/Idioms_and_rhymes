# Idioms_and_rhymes
# This is a project for rappers to use idioms with rhymes. The project was developed when I watched the famous Chinese TV program "The Rap of China". I crawled all the Chinese idioms from URL 'http://chengyu.t086.com/'. Next, I found their pinyin using "hanzi2pinyin.py" (from https://blog.csdn.net/peishuai1987/article/details/89882872). Finally, the idioms are matched by checking their vowels.
